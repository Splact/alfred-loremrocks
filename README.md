![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splact/lorem-rocks-alfred/master/preview.jpg)

## Instructions
This workflow lets you search for a lorem.rocks dictionary and copy (or directly paste) a paragraph generated at the
moment.

First of all just type `loremrocks`, here you can select the dictionary to use (continue typing to filter them).

Selecting a dictionary will copy the related paragraph to clipboard. Press `command` if you want to paste the paragraph directly into your active window.
